# Hands-On Machine Learning 3rd Edition – Jupyter Notebooks by Ahmed Abdulghany

This repository contains practical, well-documented Jupyter notebooks based on the book  
**[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (3rd Edition)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/)** by Aurélien Géron.

Each chapter is carefully implemented with:
- Executable code examples
- Concise notes and summaries
- Visualizations and outputs
- My personal insights and extensions

> Purpose: To deepen my understanding of Machine Learning and to share practical, well-documented notebooks that can help others learn and apply the concepts more easily.
